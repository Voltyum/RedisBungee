# RedisBungee (Velocity Version)

RedisBungee bridges [Redis](http://redis.io) and Velocity together. This is the solution deployed on [The Chunk](http://thechunk.net) to make sure our multi-Bungee/Velocity setup flows smoothly together.

This was made, so we can use proxies with Velocity and others with BungeeCord.

## Compiling

RedisBungee is distributed as a [maven](http://maven.apache.org) project. To compile it and install it in your local Maven repository:

    git clone https://github.com/LatamCraft/RedisBungee.git
    cd RedisBungee
    mvn clean install

## Configuration

**REDISBUNGEE REQUIRES A REDIS SERVER**, preferably with reasonably low latency. The default [config](https://github.com/LatamCraft/RedisBungee/blob/master/src/main/resources/example_config.yml) is saved when the plugin first starts.

If you want to use **RedisBungee PlaceholderAPI placeholders**, you have to use my [RedisBungee-Expansion](https://github.com/YoSoyVillaa/RedisBungee-Expansion)
